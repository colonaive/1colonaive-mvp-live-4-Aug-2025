            <p>
              COLONAiVEâ„¢ is a national movement to outsmart colorectal cancer and reduce CRC-related
              mortality through early detection, inclusive education, and access to clinically validated
              screening technologies. Founded in Singapore, the movement champions colonoscopy as the
              gold standard - the only screening method that both detects and removes precancerous
              polyps, making it the only true preventive option. COLONAiVEâ„¢ also supports HSA-cleared,
              blood-based screening tools to help more people get tested before symptoms appear. Guided
              by leading specialists and driven by partnerships across Asia-Pacific, the initiative
              empowers individuals to know when and how to screen - turning awareness into life-saving
              action. Its foundation is built on clinical evidence, real-world health impact, and
              multilingual tools that reach underserved and younger populations.

            <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              In the fight against colorectal cancer (CRC), no single group can achieve victory alone. Clinicians, with all their skill and knowledge, can only treat patients who come forward. Patients, no matter how informed, can only take action if they have access to the right screening options and understand the life-saving value of early detection. Governments can set guidelines and allocate funds, but they cannot enforce healthy habits or ensure every individual gets screened.
            </p>
            <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              This is why Project COLONAiVEâ„¢ is built on five interconnected pillars - a unified, nationwide movement where every stakeholder has a role to play:
            </p>
            <ul className="space-y-4 text-left">
              <li><strong>RID-CRC PUBâ„¢ (Public Awareness):</strong> Empowering the public with clear, accurate information on CRC, dispelling fears, and motivating them to take action.</li>
              <li><strong>RID-CRC SGPâ„¢ (Clinician Engagement):</strong> Partnering with senior clinicians to champion CRC screening as a national priority.</li>
              <li><strong>RID-CRC GOVâ„¢ (Policy Alignment):</strong> Collaborating with government agencies to align policies with our mission.</li>
              <li><strong>RID-CRC CSRâ„¢ (Corporate Sponsorships):</strong> Engaging corporations to support awareness and screening initiatives.</li>
              <li><strong>RID-CRC EDUâ„¢ (Public Education):</strong> Providing accurate, accessible CRC information to empower every individual.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-8">
              Project COLONAiVEâ„¢ is a clinician-led movement, but it thrives on collective action. Together, we are building a culture of prevention and early intervention that will save lives.
