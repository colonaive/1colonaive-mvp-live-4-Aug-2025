      {
        q: "When should I start CRC screening?",
        a: "For average-risk individuals, screening should begin at age 50. However, if you have a family history of colorectal cancer or other risk factors, your doctor may recommend starting earlier."
      },
      {
        q: "What screening options are available?",
        a: "Several options exist including colonoscopy (gold standard), blood-based tests like ColonAiQÂ®, and FIT tests. Each has its own advantages and your healthcare provider can help determine the best option for you."

    questions: [
      {
        q: "What are the early warning signs?",
        a: "Early signs may include changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, persistent abdominal discomfort, unexplained weight loss, and fatigue. However, early-stage CRC often has no symptoms, which is why regular screening is crucial."
      },
      {
        q: "What increases my risk of CRC?",
        a: "Risk factors include age (over 50), family history of CRC, certain inherited syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, smoking, heavy alcohol use, and a diet high in red/processed meats."

  {
    category: "Prevention",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How can I reduce my risk?",
        a: "You can reduce your risk through regular screening, maintaining a healthy weight, eating a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, limiting red meat consumption, staying physically active, avoiding smoking, and limiting alcohol intake."
      },
      {
        q: "Are there any dietary recommendations?",
        a: "A diet high in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while low in processed meats and red meat, may help reduce your risk. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake may also be beneficial."
