              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>
                Colorectal cancer is a common and potentially life-threatening disease that begins in the colon or rectum.
                It typically develops slowly over several years and often starts as non-cancerous polyps. 
                Detecting and removing these polyps early can prevent the development of cancer.
              </p>

              <h2>Symptoms</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Persistent changes in bowel habits</li>
                <li>Rectal bleeding or blood in stool</li>
                <li>Abdominal pain or cramps</li>
                <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
                <li>Fatigue or weakness</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
                <li>Age over 50</li>
                <li>Family history of colorectal cancer</li>
                <li>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)</li>
                <li>Low-fiber, high-fat diet</li>
                <li>Smoking and heavy alcohol use</li>
                <li>Sedentary lifestyle</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Prevention</h2>
              <p>
                Preventive strategies include regular screening (such as stool tests, colonoscopy, or blood-based screening),
                a healthy high-fiber diet, regular physical activity, avoiding tobacco, and limiting alcohol intake.
              </p>

              <h2>Importance of Early Detection</h2>
              <p>
                When detected early, colorectal cancer is highly treatable and often curable.
                Routine screening helps identify cancer at an earlier stage, and in some cases before it develops,
                significantly improving treatment outcomes and survival rates.
              </p>

              <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
              <p>
                Treatment depends on the cancer's stage and location. Options may include surgery to remove tumors,
                chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or targeted therapies. Early-stage cancers may be resolved with
                less invasive procedures and fewer long-term complications.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">🧠 About COLONAiVE™</h2>
              <p>
                COLONAiVE™ is a national movement to outsmart colorectal cancer and reduce CRC-related
                mortality through early detection, inclusive education, and access to clinically validated
                screening technologies. Founded in Singapore, the movement champions colonoscopy as the
                gold standard because it is the only screening method that both detects and removes precancerous
                polyps, making it the only true preventive option. COLONAiVE™ also supports HSA-cleared,
                blood-based screening tools to help more people get tested before symptoms appear. Guided
                by leading specialists and driven by partnerships across Asia-Pacific, the initiative
                helps individuals understand when and how to screen, turning awareness into life-saving
                action. Its foundation is built on clinical evidence, real-world health impact, and
                multilingual tools that reach underserved and younger populations.
              </p>
