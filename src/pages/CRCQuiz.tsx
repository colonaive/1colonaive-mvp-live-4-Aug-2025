    question: "What is colorectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "A type of skin cancer",
      "Cancer that starts in the colon or rectum",
      "A type of lung cancer",
      "A type of brain cancer"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Cancer that starts in the colon or rectum",
    explanation: "Colorectal cancer (CRC) begins in the colon or rectum, parts of the large intestine. It's one of the most common cancers worldwide."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "At what age should most people start screening for colorectal cancer?",
    options: ["30", "45", "60", "75"],
    correctAnswer: "45",
    explanation: "Guidelines recommend starting regular screening at age 45 for average-risk individuals, as early detection significantly improves outcomes."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "Which of the following is a common symptom of colorectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "Frequent headaches",
      "Changes in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea or constipation)",
      "Sudden weight gain",
      "Loss of vision"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Changes in bowel habits (e.g., diarrhea or constipation)",
    explanation: "CRC can grow without symptoms initially, but changes in bowel habits, blood in stool, or abdominal pain are warning signs."
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "Can regular exercise help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer?",
    options: ["Yes", "No"],
    correctAnswer: "Yes",
    explanation: "Regular physical activity, along with a healthy diet rich in vegetables and fruits, can lower your risk of developing CRC."
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What is a non-invasive screening option for colorectal cancer mentioned in recent research?",
    options: ["MRI scan", "Blood-based test (like ColonAiQ)", "X-ray", "Ultrasound"],
    correctAnswer: "Blood-based test (like ColonAiQ)",
    explanation: "Blood-based tests, such as the Multi-gene Methylation Detection Kit (ColonAiQ), detect CRC via DNA methylation with high sensitivity (89.36%) and are non-invasive alternatives to colonoscopy."
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "Which dietary habit can help reduce your risk of colorectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "Eating a diet high in processed meats and fats",
      "Consuming plenty of vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber foods",
      "Drinking sugary beverages daily",
      "Avoiding all carbohydrates"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Consuming plenty of vegetables, fruits, and high-fiber foods",
    explanation: "A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, and fiber can help prevent CRC, while high-fat and processed meat diets may increase risk."
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Which of the following symptoms should prompt you to seek medical help for possible colorectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "Occasional mild headaches",
      "Blood in your stool or rectal bleeding",
      "Temporary loss of appetite",
      "Feeling tired after exercise"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Blood in your stool or rectal bleeding",
    explanation: "Blood in the stool, even if not visible to the naked eye, can be an early sign of CRC. Other concerning symptoms include unexplained weight loss, anemia, and persistent abdominal pain. Consult a doctor immediately if you experience these."
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "Is a family history of colorectal cancer a risk factor that should lead to earlier screening?",
    options: ["Yes", "No"],
    correctAnswer: "Yes",
    explanation: "Having a parent, sibling, or child with CRC or polyps increases your risk, and you may need to start screening before age 45. Discuss with your doctor."
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "How often should healthy individuals over 50 get screened for colorectal cancer with a faecal immunochemical test (FIT)?",
    options: ["Every 5 years", "Every year", "Every 10 years", "Only once"],
    correctAnswer: "Every year",
    explanation: "For those over 50 without symptoms, an annual FIT is recommended to detect hidden blood in the stool, which can be an early sign of CRC. If positive, further testing like a colonoscopy may be needed."
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "Which lifestyle factor is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer?",
    options: [
      "Regular physical activity",
      "Maintaining a healthy weight",
      "Sedentary lifestyle and obesity",
      "Eating a fiber-rich diet"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sedentary lifestyle and obesity",
    explanation: "A sedentary lifestyle and obesity are risk factors for CRC. Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight can significantly reduce your risk."
