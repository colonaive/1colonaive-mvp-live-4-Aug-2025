        question: 'How does a blood test detect colorectal cancer?',
        answer: 'Advanced blood tests detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and other biomarkers that colorectal cancer cells release into the bloodstream. The Shieldâ„¢ test, approved by HSA, uses machine learning to analyze these signals with 94% sensitivity for cancer detection.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is a blood test as accurate as a colonoscopy?',
        answer: 'Blood tests show excellent accuracy (94% sensitivity for cancer), but colonoscopy remains the gold standard. However, blood tests are ideal for initial screening and for people who cannot or will not undergo colonoscopy. Positive results require colonoscopy follow-up.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Who should consider a blood test for colorectal cancer?',
        answer: 'Blood tests are ideal for adults 45+ at average risk, those who have delayed screening due to colonoscopy concerns, busy professionals seeking convenient screening, and as part of comprehensive health check-ups.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if my blood test is positive?',
        answer: 'A positive result means further investigation is needed, typically with colonoscopy. Your healthcare provider will arrange urgent referral and support you through the next steps. Remember, early detection leads to better outcomes.'
