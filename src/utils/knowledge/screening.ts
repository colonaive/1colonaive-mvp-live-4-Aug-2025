    question: 'What are the screening options for CRC?',
    response: 'There are several methods for colorectal cancer screening. The gold standard is colonoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the colon. Other options include stool-based tests like the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and newer blood-based tests. The best option for you depends on your age, risk factors, and personal preference.',

    question: 'Tell me about colonoscopy.',
    response: 'A colonoscopy is a procedure where a doctor uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera to look inside your entire colon and rectum. It\'s considered the most thorough screening method because it can both detect and remove polyps during the same procedure. Preparation involves a special diet and bowel cleansing beforehand.',

    intent: 'about_blood_test',
    question: 'What about the blood test for CRC?',
    response: 'Newer blood-based tests for colorectal cancer screening are becoming available, offering a less invasive option. These tests typically look for specific biomarkers associated with CRC. While convenient, it\'s important to understand their sensitivity and specificity compared to colonoscopy, and discuss with your doctor if it\'s right for you.',

    question: 'When is CRC screening recommended in Singapore?',
    response: 'In Singapore, the Ministry of Health (MOH) generally recommends regular colorectal cancer screening for average-risk individuals starting from age 50. If you have a family history or other risk factors, your doctor might recommend starting earlier. Always discuss your personal screening schedule with a qualified healthcare provider.',

    question: 'What is the general process for CRC screening?',
    response: 'The general process for CRC screening typically involves a discussion with your doctor about your risk factors, choosing a suitable screening method (like FIT, blood test, or colonoscopy), undergoing the test, and then discussing the results with your doctor. If any abnormalities are found, further investigations will be recommended.',

    response: [
      "A colonoscopy procedure itself usually takes about 30 to 45 minutes.",

    question: 'Can I eat after a colonoscopy?',
    response: [
      "Yes, you can usually eat once you're fully awake and your doctor gives the go-ahead.",
      "It's generally recommended to start with light meals and avoid heavy, fatty, or spicy foods immediately after the procedure.",

    question: 'Which test is better, FIT or blood?',
    response: 'Both the Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) and blood-based tests are non-invasive screening options for colorectal cancer. FIT detects hidden blood in stool, while blood tests look for specific biomarkers. The "better" test depends on individual factors and preferences, as well as test availability and doctor\'s recommendation. Colonoscopy remains the most comprehensive method. Always consult your doctor to determine the most suitable screening method for you.',
