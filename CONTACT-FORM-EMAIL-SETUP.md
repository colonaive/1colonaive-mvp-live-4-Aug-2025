# Contact Form Email Setup - COLONAiVE

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The "Contact Us" form has been successfully updated to send emails to `info@colonaive.ai` using the existing Resend integration.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Created Supabase Edge Function
**File:** `supabase/functions/send-contact-email/index.ts`
- Reuses existing Resend setup from the refer-a-friend feature
- Sends beautifully formatted HTML emails to `info@colonaive.ai`
- Includes all form data: name, email, subject, and message
- Differentiates response times based on inquiry type
- Media inquiries are flagged as urgent (same-day response)

### 2. Updated Contact Form
**File:** `src/pages/ContactPage.tsx`
- Added Supabase client import
- Replaced console.log with actual email sending via `supabase.functions.invoke()`
- Updated success message to specify email was sent to `info@colonaive.ai`
- Fixed email address display from `info@colonaive.com` to `info@colonaive.ai`
- Added proper error handling with user feedback

## 📧 Email Features

✅ **Professional Design**: Branded email template with COLONAiVE colors  
✅ **Complete Information**: Name, email, subject category, message, timestamp  
✅ **Priority Handling**: Media inquiries flagged as urgent  
✅ **Response Guidelines**: Clear SLA expectations based on inquiry type  
✅ **Reply-To Functionality**: Direct reply to the person who submitted  
✅ **Plain Text Fallback**: Both HTML and text versions included  

## 🎯 Email Content

The email includes:
- **Header**: COLONAiVE branding with sender information
- **Contact Details**: Name, email, category, date/time
- **Message Content**: Full message in formatted container
- **Priority Badge**: Special highlighting for media inquiries
- **Action Section**: Response time expectations and reply instructions
- **Professional Footer**: Branding and source information

## 📋 Subject Categories & Response Times

- **Clinical Partnership**: 3-5 business days  
- **Media & Press**: Same day (urgent)
- **Sponsorship & CSR**: 2-3 business days
- **Other**: 1-2 business days

## 🔄 How It Works

1. **User submits form** → `/contact` page
2. **Frontend validation** → Client-side form validation
3. **Supabase Edge Function** → `send-contact-email` function called
4. **Resend API** → Email sent to `info@colonaive.ai`
5. **Success confirmation** → User sees confirmation message

## 🚀 Testing

### Prerequisites
- Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Supabase Edge Function secrets
- Verify `info@colonaive.ai` domain is verified in Resend
- Make sure the Edge Function is deployed to Supabase

### Test Steps
1. Go to the contact page: `/contact`
2. Fill out the contact form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. Check console logs for success/error messages
5. Check `info@colonaive.ai` inbox for the email
6. Verify the email formatting and content

### Expected Results
- ✅ Form submission shows success message
- ✅ Email appears in `info@colonaive.ai` inbox
- ✅ Email has professional formatting and complete information
- ✅ Reply-to address is set to the form submitter
- ✅ Console shows successful function execution

## 🛠️ Deployment Requirements

Make sure these are configured in your Supabase project:

1. **Edge Function Deployed**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy send-contact-email
   ```

2. **Environment Variable Set**:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Domain Verified**: Ensure `colonaive.ai` is verified in your Resend account

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Function not found"**
   - Deploy the Edge Function: `supabase functions deploy send-contact-email`
   - Check function name matches exactly in the invoke call

2. **"Authentication error"**
   - Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in Supabase secrets
   - Check API key is valid in Resend dashboard

3. **"From address not verified"**
   - Verify `colonaive.ai` domain in Resend
   - Ensure the from address uses a verified domain

4. **Form submits but no email received**
   - Check spam folder at `info@colonaive.ai`
   - Check Supabase Edge Function logs
   - Check Resend delivery logs

### Debug Mode
Check browser console and Supabase Edge Function logs for detailed error messages and execution status.
